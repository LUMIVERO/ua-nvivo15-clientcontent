        <h1>Matrix coding query</h1>
        <p>The matrix coding query is a powerful, flexible tool for finding patterns in data.</p>
        <p>The queries create tables with project items (e.g. files, cases, codes or classifications) or attributes as the rows and columns. The cells show information about intersecting coding between the relevant items or attributes, e.g. the number of coding references, words coded, or cases coded. </p>
        <p>As an example, a query could have the code 'Development' as a row, and the codes 'Environment' and 'Jobs' as columns. It will find content that has been coded to 'Development' as well as to 'Environment' (in one column) and 'Jobs' (in another column). In other words, the query will find and contrast what has been said about environment and jobs with respect to development.</p>
        <p>You can color-code table cells to quickly identify where most coding occurred. Double-click cells to view the coded data.</p>
