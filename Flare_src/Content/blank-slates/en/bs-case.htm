        <h1>Cases</h1>
        <p>Cases are the people, places, organizations, events, or other entities that constitute the units of analysis in a project. </p>
        <p>Depending on the nature of your research you may not need cases, however,  analysing data in terms of attributes such as gender or age group requires cases, as well as clase classifications.</p>
        <p>All cases are saved here—you can create subfolders to help organize them. You can also create case hierarchies—for example, for a study of universities you could create the faculties as 'child' cases under each university.</p>
