        <h1>Relationships</h1>
        <p>Relationships are a type of code, representing relationships between project items (typically cases, codes or files). </p>
        <p>Each relationship has a relationship type, for example 'is employed by', or 'contributes to'. </p>
        <p>Content from data files, memos etc. can be coded to relationships in the same way it can be coded to codes or cases. For example, you could create a relationship for two codes—'education' and 'employment'—called 'education contributes to employment' and then code all content about the effect of education on employment to this relationship. </p>
