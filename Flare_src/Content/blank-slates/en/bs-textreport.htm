        <h1>Text reports</h1>
        <p>Text reports are summaries of selected project information that you can export as text, Excel or XML files for analysis in other software packages.</p>
        <p>This folder lists configurations for text reports (<MadCap:variable name="Primary.NVivo" /> does not save the resulting reports themselves). There are a number of default report configurations and you can create new ones as well. The configuration options are the same as for formatted reports—only the output format is different.</p>
        <p>Double-click a report configuration in the list to  create a report (note that some reports are configured for you to add filters when run). </p>
        <p>Because <MadCap:variable name="Primary.NVivo" /> saves report configurations, the same text report can produce reports with different content if run at different times.</p>
