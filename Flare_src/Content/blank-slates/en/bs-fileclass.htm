        <h1>File classifications</h1>
        <p>File classifications are collections of attributes (descriptive information) about your data files.</p>
        <p>For example, for photos you might want to record where and when they were taken, and by who. This collection of attributes: location, date, and author, will constitute one file classification which you could name 'Photos'. </p>
        <p>Other types of data file—for example, interview transcripts or newspaper articles—can all have their own file classifications with attributes relevant to those types of file. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.WindowsOnly">This panel shows all the file classifications in the project and their attributes.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.MacOnly">This panel shows all the file classifications in the project and the files with those classifications, along with the files' attribute values. </p>
