        <h1>Case classifications</h1>
        <p>Case classifications are collections of attributes (descriptive information)  about cases. They help ensure that you have the same attributes for all the people or other entities in your study, allowing you, later, to analyze your data in terms of these attributes.</p>
        <p>For example, for people, you might want to record gender, age-group,  and level of education. This collection of attributes: gender, age-group,  and education, will constitute one case classification. </p>
        <p>Other types of case—for example, localities or institutions—can all have their own case classifications, with attributes relevant to them. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.WindowsOnly">This panel shows all the case classifications in the project and their attributes.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.MacOnly">This panel shows all the case classifications in the project and the cases with those classifications, along with the cases' attribute values. </p>
